### Doctor Reputation System
A Move-based smart contract system on Aptos for rating doctors and providing incentives based on reputation.

### Vision
In healthcare systems worldwide, there's often a disconnect between patient experiences, doctor compensation, and quality metrics. MedTrust envisions a future where:

- Trust is Transparent: Patient feedback becomes an immutable, verifiable record that follows doctors throughout their careers
- Quality is Rewarded: Top-performing doctors receive immediate financial incentives directly tied to patient satisfaction
- Data is Decentralized: No single entity controls the reputation system, making it resistant to manipulation or centralized control
- Access is Universal: Anyone can view doctor ratings and participate in the ecosystem regardless of geographic location

MedTrust aims to fundamentally realign incentives in healthcare by creating a direct relationship between patient experiences and provider rewards, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes through stronger accountability and properly aligned incentives.
